# Basic Sorting Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains a demonstration of basic sorting algorithms implemented in C++. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear and concise reference for understanding and comparing various sorting techniques. The implemented algorithms include:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Heap Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Interchange Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Selection Sort**
7. **Shaker Sort (Cocktail Sort)**

## Algorithm Descriptions

1. **Bubble Sort:**
   Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Heap Sort:**
   Efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region.

3. **Insertion Sort:**
   Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, taking each element from the input and inserting it into its correct position.

4. **Interchange Sort:**
   A straightforward sorting algorithm that iterates through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

5. **Quick Sort:**
   Divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into smaller segments, recursively sorts them, and combines the sorted segments.

6. **Selection Sort:**
   In-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region and placing it at the beginning of the sorted region.

7. **Shaker Sort (Cocktail Sort):**
   Variation of bubble sort that sorts the array bidirectionally, first from left to right and then from right to left.
